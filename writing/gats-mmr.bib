@article{Downes:2020ab,
	abstract = {There are now a growing number of applications of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) in population health and epidemiological studies. MRP uses multilevel regression to model individual survey responses as a function of demographic and geographic covariates. Estimated mean outcome values for each demographic-geographic respondent subtype are then weighted by the proportions of each subtype in the population to produce an overall population-level estimate. We recently reported an extensive case study of a large nationwide survey and found that MRP performed favorably compared to conventional survey sampling weights for the estimation of population descriptive quantities in a highly selected sample. In this study, we aimed to evaluate, by way of a simulation experiment, both the accuracy and precision of MRP versus survey sampling weights in the context of large population health studies. While much of the research into MRP has been focused on U.S. political and social science, we considered an alternative population structure of smaller size and with notably fewer geographic subsets. We explored the impact on MRP performance of sample size, model misspecification, interactions, and the addition of a geographic-level covariate. MRP was found to achieve generally superior performance in both accuracy and precision at both the national and state levels. Results were generally robust to model misspecification, and MRP performance was further improved by the inclusion of a geographic-level covariate. These findings offer further evidence that MRP provides a promising analytic approach for addressing participation bias in the estimation of population descriptive quantities from large-scale health surveys and cohort studies.},

@article{Downes:2020aa,
	abstract = {Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is a model-based approach for estimating a population parameter of interest, generally from large-scale surveys. It has been shown to be effective in highly selected samples, which is particularly relevant to investigators of large-scale population health and epidemiologic surveys facing increasing difficulties in recruiting representative samples of participants. We aimed to further examine the accuracy and precision of MRP in a context where census data provided reasonable proxies for true population quantities of interest. We considered 2 outcomes from the baseline wave of the Ten to Men study (Australia, 2013-2014) and obtained relevant population data from the 2011 Australian Census. MRP was found to achieve generally superior performance relative to conventional survey weighting methods for the population as a whole and for population subsets of varying sizes. MRP resulted in less variability among estimates across population subsets relative to sample weighting, and there was some evidence of small gains in precision when using MRP, particularly for smaller population subsets. These findings offer further support for MRP as a promising analytical approach for addressing participation bias in the estimation of population descriptive quantities from large-scale health surveys and cohort studies.},
